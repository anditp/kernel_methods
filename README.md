# Data Challenge - Kernel methods (2024-2025)

## Classification task
This repo contains our work for the Data Challenge https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-challenge-kernel-methods-2024-2025/overview proposed as part of the Kernel Methods course from MVA. The goal of the challenge is to classify DNA sequences based on whether they are transcription factors (TF) binding sites or not.

## Structure
The file ``kernels.py`` contains most of the kernels we've experimented with. The file ``svc.py`` contains our KernelSVC implementation. The file ``start.py`` is a script for reproducing the results in our final submission.

## Results
We've obtained an overall accuracy of 0.70733 on the private data, ranking 10th out of 37 participants.
